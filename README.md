# How to use

| Setting        | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stiffness      | How much the algorithm changes the original image to make it look like the target image. Increase this if you want a more subtle transformation. |
| damping        | How much the algorithm changes the original image to make it look like the target image. Increase this if you want a more subtle transformation. |
| stretch_factor | How much the algorithm changes the original image to make it look like the target image. Increase this if you want a more subtle transformation. |
| quick_gen      | Whether to use quick generation or not. Quick generation is faster but lower quality.                                                            |
| cell_size      | Number of cells in the grid, higher cell_size = higher quality but slower                                                                        |
| source_path    | Path to the source image                                                                                                                         |
| target_path    | Path to the target image                                                                                                                         |
