# image-transport
inspired by obamify. This project will use a source image to try to simulate and move as similar as possible to the target image.

## Setup

1. **Create the imgs folder** (if not already present):
   - The `imgs` directory is automatically created when you run the scripts
   - Alternatively, you can create it manually: `mkdir imgs`

2. **Add your images**:
   - Place your source image as `imgs/source.png`
   - Place your target image as `imgs/target (1).png`

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or generate a random noise image:
```bash
python random_img.py
```
